Outline of the Application we will be building:
 - Post an anonymous note about a subject or event you are interested in and would like to start a conversation about.
 - Once the note is sent, you will receive a note sent by another user and may respond if you are interested in the topic.
 - A different user will see your note and will respond if they are interested in the same subject/event. 
 - After someone picks your note (or you pick someone's note), it changes into a chat platform between the two of users.
 - The chat lifetime is entirely up to users, as long as they keep replying within a defined timeframe, the chat remains.
 - This platform's goal is to create a conversations between people who are interested in a common event or subject.
