Outline of the Application we will be building:
 - Post a note about a subject or event you are interested in and would like to start a conversation about this note.
 - Someone else will see your note and will repond if that person is interest in the same subject/event. 
 - After someone picks your note it changes into a chat platform between the two of users about the choosen suject/event. 
 - This platform is mainly to create a conversations between people who are interested in a common topic/event or subject.
 - Overtime if necessary the two users can exchange contacts if they find that they have a lot in common but this is conpletely upto the user.
